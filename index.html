                <h3>Beef</h3>
                <p>
                    Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times.
                     Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into
                     certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak
                     , etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from
                     older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called
                      blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the 
                      reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although 
                      forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys
                      , and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters).
                       Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are 
                       used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.  Beef from steers and heifers is similar.
                        Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher,
                         is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on 
                         grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated
                          animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend
                    Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide, after pork and 
                    poultry at 38% and 30% respectively. In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are
                     the world's three largest consumers of beef; Uruguay, however, has the highest beef and veal consumption per capita, followed 
                     by Argentina and Brazil. According to the data from OECD, the average Uruguayan ate over 42 kg (93 lb) of beef or veal in 2014,
                      representing the highest beef/veal consumption per capita in the world. In comparison, the average American consumed only about
                       24 kg (53 lb) beef or veal in the same year, while African countries, such as Mozambique, Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least
                        beef or veal per capital. In 2015, the world's largest exporters of beef were India, Brazil and Australia.Beef production is also
                     important to the economies of Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Paraguay, Mexico, Belarus and Nicaragua.

                <h3>Sushi</h3>
            <p>
                Sushi  is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients ,
                 such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key
                  ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari .Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can 
                  be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon,
                   tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and 
                   soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish. Sushi is sometimes confused with 
                    sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional 
                    serving of rice.Sushi  is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients ,
